We've all had instructors that, let's just say, provided alot of friendly *guidance* for what material would appear on an exam (they were pretty popular professors). Often this was in the form of a \"practice exam\". This led to a scenario where the exam was for all intents and purposes observed before exam day, and those who could memorize well were likely to achieve the most success. As much as stressed out college students might enjoy it, this arrangement does not facilitate genuine learning, which is demonstrated by the ability to accurately generalize concepts and constructs to new scenarios.  This is why we split data. So that instead of memorizing content and being tested on how well we can repeat it, we are attempting to learn the \"how\" and \"why\" behind the data generating process so that when new data comes from the process, we can legitimately demonstrate a deep level of understanding. Splitting the data into a train set an a test set, and not using the test set at all to learn patterns in the data will enable our model to demonstrate this deeper understanding.
