Here we identified missing values and dropped columns with over 50% missing data, which impacts how duplicates are found.\n","\n","### Impact of Dropping High Missingness Columns\n","\n","Dropping columns with a high percentage of missing values affects subsequent data cleaning steps, including duplicate detection. If this step were performed *after* splitting the data, the training and testing sets might have different sets of columns dropped based on their individual missingness profiles. This could lead to inconsistencies between the training and testing data, potentially impacting model performance and interpretability. Performing this removal *before* splitting ensures that both the training and testing sets have the same set of features based on the overall data's missingness patterns. This consistent feature set then allows for more reliable duplicate detection based on the remaining, more complete columns across the entire dataset before the split.\n","\n","### Imputation and Data Leakage\n","\n","After handling high missingness and duplicates, remaining missing values need imputation. To prevent **data leakage**, it's vital to impute *after* splitting data into training and testing sets.\n","\n","Data leakage occurs when test set information influences the training process. If imputation values (like means) are calculated using the entire dataset before splitting, information from the test set leaks into the training set.\n","\n","**Imputing After Splitting:**\n","\n","*   Calculate imputation values (e.g., mean) using *only* the training data.\n","*   Fill missing values in the training set using these training-based values.\n","*   Fill missing values in the testing set using the *same* values calculated from the training set.\n","\n","This approach ensures the model learns to handle missing data based only on the training set's patterns, accurately reflecting how it would perform on new, unseen data. Imputing before splitting can lead to an overestimation of model performance on the test set.\n","\n","Therefore, imputing missing values after splitting is crucial for preventing data leakage and getting a realistic measure of your model's ability to generalize."],"metadata":{"id":"fw09RUPmLrsT"}},{"source":["##### 2.3.1 Exclude variables with excessive missingness.\n","\n","Identify columns with more than 50% missing values and drop them from the dataframe.\n","\n"],"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BSq8pF09VOYc"}},{"source":["missing_values_count = df.isnull().sum()\n","total_rows = len(df)\n","columns_to_drop = missing_values_count[missing_values_count / total_rows > 0.5].index.tolist()\n","df.drop(columns=columns_to_drop, inplace=True)\n","display(f\"Number of remaining columns: {df.shape[1]}\")\n","display(df.head())"],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":384},"id":"_n4A9YZPVOoL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750437138514,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":70,"user":{"displayName":"Juan Carlos Apitz","userId":"03950181818081360563"}},"outputId":"b73779bc-3023-491a-e9d7-e5f5837aa478"},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["'Number of remaining columns: 18'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["         SID     COHORT             RACE_ETHNICITY  GENDER  \\\n","0  UHDOP5522  Fall 2020                      Asian  Female   \n","1  UHE842CU6  Fall 2021  Black or African American  Female   \n","2  UHJFT1JAB  Fall 2018                      Asian  Female   \n","3  UHKF05TAF  Fall 2018                   Hispanic  Female   \n","4  UHKKQ8UY5  Fall 2021                   Hispanic    Male   \n","\n","        FIRST_GEN_STATUS  HS_MATH_GPA  HS_ENGL_GPA                   COLLEGE  \\\n","0  Continuing Generation          3.2        3.400  Visual & Performing Arts   \n","1  Continuing Generation          2.6        3.750  Visual & Performing Arts   \n","2  Continuing Generation          3.4        3.500  Visual & Performing Arts   \n","3       First Generation          3.0        3.375      Letters & Humanities   \n","4  Continuing Generation          2.5        2.625      Letters & Humanities   \n","\n","   UNITS_ATTEMPTED_1  UNITS_ATTEMPTED_2  UNITS_COMPLETED_1  UNITS_COMPLETED_2  \\\n","0               15.0               14.0               15.0               15.0   \n","1               12.0               12.0               12.0               12.0   \n","2               15.0               15.0               15.0               16.0   \n","3               16.0                9.0                7.0                3.0   \n","4               13.0               13.0               13.0               13.0   \n","\n","   DFW_UNITS_1  DFW_UNITS_2     GPA_1     GPA_2  GPA_3 SEM_3_STATUS  \n","0          0.0          0.0  4.000000  3.785714    4.0            E  \n","1          3.0          4.0  3.000000  2.500000    1.5            E  \n","2          0.0          0.0  3.800000  3.600000    3.6            E  \n","3          9.0          9.0  1.562500  1.000000    2.5            E  \n","4          0.0          0.0  3.538462  3.769231    3.4            E  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-02fa4a1c-b9c0-4d8a-bcbc-599d66918997\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>SID</th>\n","      <th>COHORT</th>\n","      <th>RACE_ETHNICITY</th>\n","      <th>GENDER</th>\n","      <th>FIRST_GEN_STATUS</th>\n","      <th>HS_MATH_GPA</th>\n","      <th>HS_ENGL_GPA</th>\n","      <th>COLLEGE</th>\n","      <th>UNITS_ATTEMPTED_1</th>\n","      <th>UNITS_ATTEMPTED_2</th>\n","      <th>UNITS_COMPLETED_1</th>\n","      <th>UNITS_COMPLETED_2</th>\n","      <th>DFW_UNITS_1</th>\n","      <th>DFW_UNITS_2</th>\n","      <th>GPA_1</th>\n","      <th>GPA_2</th>\n","      <th>GPA_3</th>\n","      <th>SEM_3_STATUS</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>UHDOP5522</td>\n","      <td>Fall 2020</td>\n","      <td>Asian</td>\n","      <td>Female</td>\n","      <td>Continuing Generation</td>\n","      <td>3.2</td>\n","      <td>3.400</td>\n","      <td>Visual &amp;

We've all had instructors that, let's just say, provided alot of friendly *guidance* for what material would appear on an exam (they were pretty popular professors). Often this was in the form of a \"practice exam\". This led to a scenario where the exam was for all intents and purposes observed before exam day, and those who could memorize well were likely to achieve the most success. As much as stressed out college students might enjoy it, this arrangement does not facilitate genuine learning, which is demonstrated by the ability to accurately generalize concepts and constructs to new scenarios.  This is why we split data. So that instead of memorizing content and being tested on how well we can repeat it, we are attempting to learn the \"how\" and \"why\" behind the data generating process so that when new data comes from the process, we can legitimately demonstrate a deep level of understanding. Splitting the data into a train set an a test set, and not using the test set at all to learn patterns in the data will enable our model to demonstrate this deeper understanding.
